    "Edgar Anderson's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set\">iris dataset</a> was made famous by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher\">Sir Roland Fisher</a>'s analysis in his famous 1936 paper, \"<a href=\"https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/15227\">The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems</a>\". The dataset consists of measurements of physical characteristics -- *sepal length*, *sepal width*, *petal length*, and *petal width* -- of various species of the iris flower -- *Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor* -- collected with an eye to quantifying morphological variation. Nowadays, analysis of the Iris dataset is a staple of statistical pedagogy.\n",
